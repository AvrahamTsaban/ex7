Hi claude! I would like you to develop python code for the connect 4 game. The game should be written in python, and compatibility with python 3.9.25 should be preserved.  
I hope you can do it in fluent, readable style. examples of target game are provided as attachments. 

General policies: added in policy.file. Basically, you should stick to the general way my c example code works (attachment), but if you need consulting, you may consalt the basic assignement file. 
So, requirements according to order of importance: 
1. First, adhere to policy.file guidelines.
2. Afterwards, try and adhere to ex3.c's way of aprroaching assignment.
3. If something is still unclear, consule ex3_instructions.md
4. adhere to codind style (attachment).

If there is some contradiction between sources, notify me. 
If my instructions are unclear, you need more info, or you just think my english should be improved, please prompt me; help me help you (;

It is nice but tic-tac-toe mode does not look to be real ttt; have you read the instructions?

## msg 3
excellent. now, read all the instructions again. Ensure there are no errors and no contradiction between your code and instruction code, and ensure your code is as clean and simple as possible.

## msg 4
add tic_tac_toe_input a simple check to avoid getting input to same adress twice
